## 2024-03-20: Scheduler Validation

Completed a thorough validation of all scheduled tasks in the WandererNotifier application:

1. **Created scheduler validation documentation** - Created a comprehensive markdown document at `notes/scheduler_validation.md` that documents all scheduled tasks, their behavior, timing, and validation status.

2. **Validated four main schedulers**:

   - TPS Chart Scheduler (time-based, runs daily at 12:00 UTC)
   - Activity Chart Scheduler (interval-based, runs every 24 hours)
   - Character Update Scheduler (interval-based, runs every 30 minutes)
   - System Update Scheduler (interval-based, runs every 60 minutes)

3. **Documented scheduler architecture** - Outlined the well-structured scheduler system including BaseScheduler, IntervalScheduler, TimeScheduler, Factory, Registry, and Supervisor.

4. **Verified timing configurations** - Confirmed that all schedulers use timing values from the centralized `WandererNotifier.Core.Config.Timings` module.

5. **Made recommendations** for future improvements including more comprehensive error handling, retry logic for API failures, telemetry for scheduler execution, and a web dashboard for monitoring.

The task is now marked as completed in the task list. Next priority tasks include creating an enhanced startup message and migrating from QuickCharts to the node chart service.
