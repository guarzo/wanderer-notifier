# WandererNotifier Testing Guide

This document provides detailed instructions for testing the notification functionality after the refactoring changes.

## Prerequisites

1. Access to a Discord server with appropriate channels set up
2. Valid and invalid license scenarios available for testing
3. Running development environment for the WandererNotifier
4. Access to zkillboard websocket and API endpoints
5. Access to EVE Map API endpoints

## 1. Kill Notification Testing

### First Message Enhancement Test
1. Start the application with a clean state (no lingering Process dictionary)
2. Trigger a kill notification
3. **Expected Result**: 
   - The first kill notification should be fully enriched with a rich embed
   - It should contain victim details, ship information, and attacker details
   - Confirm in logs: "Sending first kill notification in enriched format (startup message)"

### License Gating Test
1. Set license to invalid state
2. Trigger multiple kill notifications (after first one)
3. **Expected Result**:
   - Only the first kill notification should be enriched
   - Subsequent notifications should be basic text messages
4. Set license to valid state  
5. Trigger additional kill notifications
6. **Expected Result**:
   - All notifications should now be rich embeds

### Data Fallback Test
1. Send a kill notification with incomplete victim data (missing corporation)
2. **Expected Result**:
   - System should attempt to lookup corporation name from ESI
   - If ESI fails, it should use a fallback value
   - Check logs to confirm ESI lookup behavior

### zkillboard Link Test
1. Click on the zkillboard links in a kill notification
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Links should go to the correct zkillboard pages for the kill, character, etc.

## 2. Character Notification Testing

### First Character Notification Test
1. Restart the application
2. Trigger a character notification for a tracked character
3. **Expected Result**:
   - The first character notification should be fully enriched regardless of license
   - It should show character name, portrait, and corporation details 
   - Confirm in logs: "Sending first character notification in enriched format (startup message)"

### Corporation Name Extraction Test
1. Trigger notifications for characters with and without corporation information
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Character with corporation: Corporation name displayed correctly
   - Character without corporation: Appropriate fallback displayed
   - Character with just ticker: Ticker displayed in square brackets

### Portrait Image Test
1. Check the character portrait in the notification
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Image should properly load from EVE image server
   - URL format should be correct: `https://imageserver.eveonline.com/Character/[id]_128.jpg`

## 3. System Notification Testing

### First System Notification Test
1. Restart the application
2. Add a system to tracking
3. **Expected Result**:
   - First system notification should be enriched regardless of license status
   - Confirm in logs: "Sending first system notification in enriched format (startup message)"

### System Type Test
Test with multiple system types:
1. Highsec system
2. Lowsec system
3. Nullsec system
4. Wormhole system (with class information)

**Expected Results**:
- Each system should have appropriate type description
- The notification color should match the security status (green, yellow, red, blue)
- Wormhole systems should include effect information when available
- K-space systems should show region information

### Static Information Test
1. Test notifications for wormhole systems with statics
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Static wormhole types should be listed in the notification
   - For shattered wormholes, the "Shattered" attribute should be visible

### Region Information Test
1. Test notifications for systems in various regions
2. **Expected Result**:
   - Region name should be correctly displayed
   - Region name should be a clickable link to dotlan

## 4. WebSocket Functionality Testing

### Connection Monitoring Test
1. Start the application and check connection status
2. **Expected Result**:
   - WebSocket connects successfully to zkillboard
   - Status information is updated in logs and stats

### Reconnection Test
1. Temporarily disable network connectivity
2. Wait for automatic reconnection attempts
3. Restore network connectivity
4. **Expected Result**:
   - WebSocket should attempt to reconnect
   - Logs should show reconnection attempts
   - After network restoration, WebSocket should reconnect

### Message Flow Test
1. Ensure zkillboard is sending kill messages
2. Monitor the system for incoming messages
3. **Expected Result**:
   - Kill messages should be received from zkillboard
   - Messages should be processed and trigger notifications
   - Logs should show message transmission through the system

### Circuit Breaker Test
1. Create conditions for frequent disconnections
2. **Expected Result**:
   - After reaching disconnection threshold, circuit breaker should engage
   - Logs should show: "Circuit breaker engaged after X disconnects in Y seconds"
   - Reconnection should be delayed using exponential backoff

## 5. General Testing

### License Validation Test
1. Test with valid license:
   - Ensure all notification types are enriched
2. Test with invalid license:
   - Only first notification of each type should be enriched
   - Subsequent notifications should be simple text
3. Change license during runtime:
   - Behavior should change accordingly without restart

### Error Handling Test
1. Test with intentionally malformed data
2. **Expected Result**:
   - System should handle errors gracefully
   - Appropriate fallback values should be used
   - Logs should show meaningful error messages

### Startup Behavior Test
1. Restart the application multiple times
2. **Expected Result**:
   - WebSocket should connect reliably
   - First notification flags should reset properly
   - Application should initialize correctly without errors

## Reporting Test Results

When testing, please note:
1. Any unexpected behavior or discrepancies
2. Performance issues or delays
3. Error messages or exceptions
4. Specific test cases that failed or succeeded
5. Log snippets that illuminate system behavior

notification matches specification, but we should make the corpration name/ticker into a link to the zkillboard for the corporation


- invalid license testing 

we don't seem to be tracking if we've send the first message? mayube just an issue with test notifications??

-- other comment
we should send a more detailed message a startup, a nicely formatted embedded message including the features enabled -- and the post-start systems/characters trackedup

we clearly have the corporation id if we're able to get the ticker, why aren't we able to provide the corporation name and the  zkilboard link?
