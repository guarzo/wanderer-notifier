## Week 2: Quality Assurance & Performance

### Day 8-9: Test Coverage Improvement
- [ ] **Analyze current coverage** (19.5%):
  - [ ] Generate coverage report
  - [ ] Identify critical uncovered paths
  - [ ] Prioritize by risk/importance

  - [ ] Error handling paths
- [ ] **Achieve coverage milestones**:
  - [ ] 40% by end of Day 8
  - [ ] 60% by end of Day 9
  - [ ] 70%+ final target

### Day 10-11: Performance Benchmarking
- [ ] **Create benchmark suite**:
  ```elixir
  defmodule WandererNotifier.Benchmarks do
    use Benchfella
    
    bench "HTTP request (ESI)" do
      # Benchmark unified HTTP client
    end
    
    bench "Cache operations" do
      # Benchmark simplified cache
    end
    
    bench "Notification flow" do
      # Benchmark end-to-end notification
    end
  end
  ```
- [ ] **Establish baseline metrics**:
  - [ ] HTTP request latency (p50, p95, p99)
  - [ ] Cache operation times
  - [ ] Notification processing time
  - [ ] Memory usage patterns
  - [ ] Concurrent request handling
- [ ] **Compare with pre-refactoring baseline** (if available)
- [ ] **Document performance results**

### Day 12: Integration Testing
- [ ] **End-to-end notification flow**:
  - [ ] WebSocket → Pipeline → NotificationService → Discord
  - [ ] HTTP fallback scenarios
  - [ ] Error handling paths
- [ ] **Service integration tests**:
  - [ ] ESI API integration
  - [ ] License validation flow
  - [ ] WandererKills API integration
- [ ] **Cache warming and invalidation**
- [ ] **Rate limiting verification**

### Day 13: Final Polish
- [ ] **Code quality improvements**:
  - [ ] Run `mix format --check-formatted`
  - [ ] Run `mix credo --strict`
  - [ ] Update type specs where missing
  - [ ] Add missing @doc annotations
- [ ] **Documentation updates**:
  - [ ] Update any outdated documentation
  - [ ] Add migration guide for breaking changes
  - [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] **Dependency audit**:
  - [ ] Check for unused dependencies
  - [ ] Update outdated dependencies
  - [ ] Security vulnerability scan

### Day 14: Production Readiness
- [ ] **Create deployment checklist**:
  - [ ] Environment variable documentation
  - [ ] Required external services
  - [ ] Minimum resource requirements
  - [ ] Monitoring setup guide
- [ ] **Performance optimization** (if needed based on benchmarks):
  - [ ] Optimize hot paths
  - [ ] Adjust cache TTLs
  - [ ] Tune HTTP client settings
- [ ] **Final test run**:
  - [ ] Full test suite with coverage
  - [ ] Load testing
  - [ ] Stress testing
- [ ] **Create release candidate**

## Success Criteria

### Required for Completion
- [ ] Zero compilation warnings
- [ ] 100% test suite passing
- [ ] 70%+ test coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented
- [ ] No regression in key metrics
- [ ] All Sprint 1 cleanup completed

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Health**: 0 failing tests (from 185)
- **Coverage**: 70%+ (from 19.5%)
- **Warnings**: 0 (from ~15)
- **Code Quality**: Credo score > 90%
- **Performance**: No regression > 10%

## Risk Management

### High Risk Items
1. **Test Suite Recovery**: 185 failing tests is significant
   - Mitigation: Prioritize by impact, fix in batches
2. **Performance Regression**: Unknown impact of refactoring
   - Mitigation: Early benchmarking, optimization time reserved
3. **Breaking Changes**: Removing modules may break external consumers
   - Mitigation: Careful analysis, migration guide

### Contingency Plans
1. If test coverage goal unreachable:
   - Focus on critical path coverage (minimum 50%)
   - Document uncovered areas for future work
2. If performance regression found:
   - Identify specific bottlenecks
   - Consider partial rollback of problematic changes
3. If timeline at risk:
   - Prioritize production-critical fixes
   - Defer nice-to-have improvements

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All compilation warnings resolved
- [ ] Test suite 100% passing
- [ ] Test coverage ≥ 70%
- [ ] Performance benchmarks completed and documented
- [ ] No significant performance regression (< 10%)
- [ ] All critical bugs fixed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off received

## Post-Sprint Activities

1. **Knowledge Transfer Session**: Share learnings from refactoring
2. **Retrospective**: What worked, what didn't, lessons learned
3. **Technical Debt Log**: Document any remaining improvements
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Ensure production metrics are tracked
5. **Maintenance Plan**: Schedule regular architecture reviews

## Notes

This sprint is critical for production readiness. The test suite health is the highest priority, as it blocks confident deployment. Performance validation is second priority to ensure the refactoring hasn't introduced regressions. All team members should focus on these priorities before any new feature work.
