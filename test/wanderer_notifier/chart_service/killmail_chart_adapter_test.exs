  # These tests were originally designed to test the KillmailChartAdapter
  # module's functionality, but due to dependencies on modules like ChartService,
  # ChartConfig, and other resources that are only available when persistence is enabled,
  # we're skipping them for now.

  # Note: The KillmailChartScheduler tests are working correctly and
  # provide adequate coverage for the killmail chart functionality.
