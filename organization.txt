2. Update module namespaces
After moving files, update their defmodule names and alias references. E.g.:

elixir
COMPLETED
- Updated module names for all moved files
- Updated references in dependent modules:
  * Updated application.ex to use Killmail.MetricRegistry instead of KillmailProcessing.MetricRegistry

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

1. Update one module or context at a time
2. Always maintain backward compatibility until fully migrated
3. Use deprecation notices to signal upcoming changes
4. Add comprehensive tests before major changes
5. Run the test suite after each significant change
6. Document architectural decisions
7. Use static analysis tools to find missed references

**CRITICAL: DO NOT REPLACE BUSINESS LOGIC WITH PLACEHOLDERS**
When refactoring, it's absolutely essential to preserve all existing business logic.
- NEVER replace actual business logic with stub implementations or placeholders
- Always move implementation details completely and accurately
- Verify all edge cases and conditional logic are preserved exactly as they were
- Use comprehensive tests to validate that behavior is unchanged
- When consolidating modules, ensure ALL functionality is migrated, not just the "happy path"
- Pay special attention to error handling and edge cases
This is the most critical aspect of the refactoring - structure can change, but behavior must remain identical.

SUCCESS CRITERIA

The refactoring will be considered complete when:
1. All code is organized into proper domain contexts
2. No deprecated modules remain in the codebase
3. All tests pass with the new structure
4. The application functions correctly in all environments
5. Documentation is updated to reflect the new architecture
6. Performance meets or exceeds pre-refactoring metrics

This comprehensive plan provides a roadmap to complete the refactoring process over the next 4-7 weeks, depending on available resources and complexity encountered during implementation.
