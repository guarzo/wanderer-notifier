        **General Code Quality** – Ensure the code follows global best practices:
        - Keep functions and modules small and focused (single responsibility).
        - Use consistent naming conventions and meaningful identifiers for clarity.
        - Look for unused code or files that can be removed
        - Avoid duplicate code – refactor common logic into reusable functions.
        - Maintain code readability (proper indentation, avoid deep nesting of code).
        - Write comments where necessary to explain intent, but keep code self-explanatory.
        - Use early exit strategy, avoid else use pattern matching
