## Session Summaries

### Session 2024-03-25-1

#### Reviewed

- Initial review setup

- Detailed review of `mix.exs`
  - Version management
  - Elixir version specifications
  - Dependencies analysis
  - Ranch override investigation

#### Key Findings

1. Version Management Needs

   - Project version hardcoded at 1.0.0
   - No automated version management
   - Need for VERSION file and git_ops integration

2. Elixir Version Consistency

   - Version 1.18 specified in multiple places
   - Need for centralized version management
   - Opportunity for asdf integration

3. Dependencies
   - Duplicate testing libraries (mock and Mox)
   - Ranch override needed for dependency resolution
   - All dependencies up to date

### Session 2024-03-25-2

#### Reviewed

- Configuration files in `config/` directory
  - `config.exs` - Base configuration
  - `runtime.exs` - Runtime and sensitive configuration
  - Environment-specific configs pending review

#### Key Findings

1. Configuration Structure

   - Well-organized base configuration
   - Good separation of compile-time and runtime configs
   - Extensive use of environment variables for configuration

2. Security Considerations

   - Sensitive values properly handled in runtime.exs
   - Token validation present but could be enhanced
   - Environment variables properly sourced with fallbacks

3. Feature Management
   - Feature flags implemented but scattered
   - Some features lack documentation
   - Good default values provided

### Session 2024-03-25-3

#### Reviewed

- Environment-specific configuration files
  - `dev.exs` - Development configuration
  - `prod.exs` - Production configuration
  - `test.exs` - Test configuration

#### Key Findings

1. Development Environment

   - Good hot code reloading setup with exsync
   - Frontend asset watching configured
   - Detailed logging for development
   - Missing development-specific feature flags

2. Production Environment

   - Appropriate log levels and formatting
   - Module-specific log levels defined
   - Good separation of runtime configuration
   - Missing log rotation configuration

3. Test Environment
   - Well-structured mock configurations
   - Feature flags properly configured for testing
   - Good isolation of external services
   - Clear test-specific timeouts

### Session 2024-03-25-4

#### Reviewed

- Application entry point and initialization
  - `lib/wanderer_notifier/application.ex`

  - Supervision tree
  - Development and test support

#### Key Findings

1. Application Structure

   - Well-organized startup phases

   - Comprehensive logging and tracking
   - Proper environment handling

2. Startup Process

   - Phased initialization with tracking
   - Database connection retry logic
   - Feature flag awareness
   - Startup notification system

3. Code Organization Issues
   - File is over 500 lines and handles too many concerns
   - Database requirement logic needs review
   - Startup skip functionality needs consolidation
   - Cache generation logic should be extracted

   - Debug mode support with environment variable
   - Complex metadata conversion logic
   - Good error handling for invalid metadata

2. Database Management

   - Clean release tasks implementation
   - Good error handling in migrations
   - Health check implementation
   - Extension management support
   - Transaction handling for Ash framework

3. Notifier System
   - Clear behavior definition
   - Good separation of concerns
   - Support for various notification types
   - Missing validation and rate limiting

## Review Notes

### Strengths

1. **Cache Implementation**

   - Comprehensive caching strategy for systems and characters
   - Good error handling and logging
   - DRY principles with shared helper functions
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **Code Organization**
   - Well-structured module hierarchy
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Modular design

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Cache System**

   - Multiple cache key formats need standardization
   - Redundant data storage patterns
   - Missing cache invalidation strategy
   - Limited cache performance monitoring

2. **Error Handling**

   - Inconsistent error handling patterns
   - Some error cases not properly handled
   - Missing retry mechanisms in critical paths
   - Incomplete error logging

3. **Documentation**
   - Some modules lack comprehensive documentation
   - Missing examples in critical sections
   - Incomplete API documentation
   - Need more architectural documentation
