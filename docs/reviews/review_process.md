# Code Review Process Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines our systematic approach for conducting comprehensive code reviews. The process is designed to be thorough, documented, and actionable.

## Review Methodology

### 1. Review Structure

#### File Review Order

1. **Core Configuration**

   - `mix.exs` (dependencies, project configuration)
   - Environment configuration files
   - CI/CD configuration
   - Deployment configurations

2. **Application Structure**

   - Directory organization
   - Module hierarchy
   - Naming conventions
   - File organization

3. **Core Application Code**

   - Main application modules
   - Critical business logic
   - API endpoints
   - Database interactions

4. **Supporting Components**
   - Test files
   - Documentation
   - Scripts and utilities
   - Assets and resources

### 2. Review Aspects

For each component, examine:

#### Code Quality

- Consistency with project standards
- Function and module organization
- Naming conventions
- Documentation completeness
- Error handling patterns
- Performance considerations

#### Architecture

- Component relationships
- Dependency management
- Data flow patterns
- State management
- API design
- Security considerations

#### Testing

- Test coverage
- Test quality and organization
- Mock/stub usage
- Integration test coverage
- Performance test coverage

#### Documentation

- Inline documentation
- Module documentation
- API documentation
- Setup guides
- Architecture documentation

## Review Process

### 1. Session Management

#### Starting a Session

1. Review previous session summary
2. Check action items status
3. Identify focus area
4. Set clear session goals

#### During the Session

1. Document findings in real-time
2. Create specific, actionable items
3. Update progress tracking
4. Note any blockers or dependencies

#### Ending a Session

1. Update documentation
2. Write session summary
3. Update action items
4. Define next session's starting point
5. Document any pending thoughts

### 2. Documentation Requirements

#### Session Summary Template

```markdown
## Session Summary YYYY-MM-DD

### Reviewed

- Files/components reviewed
- Current progress: `path/to/file.ex` (line XX)

### Key Findings

- Major discoveries
- Decisions made

### Next Session

- Starting point
- Priority areas
```

### 3. Prioritization Guidelines

1. **Critical Issues**

   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Data integrity issues
   - System stability problems
   - Performance bottlenecks

2. **Important Improvements**

   - Code quality issues
   - Technical debt
   - Documentation gaps
   - Test coverage

3. **Nice-to-Have Updates**
   - Style improvements
   - Minor optimizations
   - Additional features
   - Enhanced documentation

## Best Practices

### 1. Documentation

- Document findings immediately
- Include context for changes
- Reference specific files/lines
- Link to external resources
- Use clear, specific language
- Include examples where helpful

### 2. Communication

- Be clear and specific
- Document assumptions
- Note areas of uncertainty
- Use standardized terminology
- Keep summaries concise

### 3. Tools Usage

- Code analysis tools
- Documentation generators
- Test coverage tools
- Performance profilers
- Security scanners

## Maintenance

This document should be:

1. Updated as the process evolves
2. Referenced at each review start
3. Used for reviewer onboarding
4. Periodically reviewed
5. Maintained as a living document

## Review Completion Criteria

A review is complete when:

1. All planned components are examined
2. Findings are documented
3. Action items are created
4. Next steps are defined
5. Documentation is updated

## Continuous Improvement

### Process Refinement

- Regularly evaluate effectiveness
- Gather reviewer feedback
- Update based on lessons learned
- Adapt to project needs

### Documentation Updates

- Keep process current
- Add new best practices
- Update templates as needed
- Remove obsolete information
