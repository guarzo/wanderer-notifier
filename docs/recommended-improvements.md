# Recommended Improvements for Wanderer Notifier

Based on a comprehensive code review, here are recommended improvements for the Wanderer Notifier project, organized by priority and category.

## High Priority

### Performance Improvements

- [ ] Implement connection pooling for HTTP requests to improve API call efficiency
- [ ] Optimize cache expiration strategies to reduce memory usage while maintaining performance
- [ ] Add circuit breakers for external API calls to prevent cascading failures
- [ ] Implement batching for Discord notifications during high-volume events

### Reliability & Error Handling

- [ ] Enhance error logging with structured formats for better debugging
- [ ] Add automatic retries with exponential backoff for transient API failures
- [ ] Improve webhook reconnection logic with proper backoff strategies
- [ ] Implement better dead letter handling for failed notifications

### Security

- [ ] Review environment variable handling to ensure sensitive data is properly protected
- [ ] Add request rate limiting for web endpoints
- [ ] Implement proper CORS configuration for API endpoints
- [ ] Audit third-party dependencies for security vulnerabilities

## Medium Priority

### Code Quality

- [ ] Increase unit test coverage across core functionality
- [ ] Update dependency versions to latest compatible releases
- [ ] Refactor large modules like kill_processor.ex into smaller, more focused components
- [ ] Add typespecs to all public functions for better documentation and dialyzer support

### DevOps & Deployment

- [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD automation
- [ ] Create separate development/staging/production environment configurations
- [ ] Add health check endpoints for better container orchestration
- [ ] Implement proper database migrations for persistent data

### Documentation

- [ ] Update code documentation with more examples and use cases
- [ ] Create API documentation for any exposed endpoints
- [ ] Add sequence diagrams for main notification flows
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Low Priority

### Feature Enhancements

- [ ] Add support for more notification channels (e.g., Slack, Telegram)
- [ ] Implement user-customizable notification templates
- [ ] Add metrics collection for operation monitoring
- [ ] Create admin dashboard for configuration and monitoring

### Development Experience

- [ ] Add more developer tooling (credo, dialyzer, ex_doc) with default configurations
- [ ] Improve development container with additional tooling
- [ ] Create more comprehensive example configurations for different use cases
- [ ] Add CHANGELOG.md file to track version changes

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Replace deprecated API calls in discord/notifier.ex
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate code in notification formatters
- [ ] Refactor config.ex to use proper configuration patterns
- [ ] Clean up unused variables and functions across the codebase

## Architectural Considerations

- [ ] Evaluate potential for using GenStage or Flow for better back-pressure handling
- [ ] Consider transition to umbrella project structure for better separation of concerns
- [ ] Review database schema design for future scalability
- [ ] Consider implementing event sourcing pattern for better audit trail of system activities

Each task should be independently implementable, allowing for incremental improvements to the codebase. The tasks are ordered based on their impact on system reliability, performance, and maintainability.
