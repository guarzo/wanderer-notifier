# Sprint 6: Resilience & Production Readiness

**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Progress Summary

### Completed Tasks
1. ✅ **Task 6.5: Production Optimization** - COMPLETED
   - Enhanced production configuration with structured logging and performance tuning
   - Optimized Dockerfile with Erlang VM flags and security hardening
   - Implemented comprehensive health checks with readiness/liveness endpoints
   - Created production deployment verification script
   - All quality gates passed

2. ✅ **Legacy Code Cleanup** - COMPLETED
   - Removed deprecated `map_url_with_name` function and all usages
   - Removed unnecessary RedisQ/ZKillboard configuration functions
   - Replaced placeholder code in cache warmer with actual ESI service calls
   - Simplified cache version manager to eliminate migration noise on startup

3. ✅ **Rate Limiting Improvements** - COMPLETED
   - Added exponential backoff to License Service (up to 32x base interval)
   - Implemented exponential backoff for WebSocket reconnections (1s → 60s max)
   - Increased SSE client jitter from 10% to 30-50%
   - Added custom rate limiting for license endpoints (1 req/sec)

4. ✅ **Bug Fixes** - COMPLETED
   - Fixed compilation errors (unused variables, undefined functions)
   - Fixed Dialyzer type issues in health controller
   - Fixed cache warmer crash by adding Task completion handlers
   - Fixed Phoenix endpoint status checking

### Task 6.5: Production Optimization
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Files Modified**:
- `config/prod.exs` - Enhanced with production optimizations
- `Dockerfile` - Optimized with Erlang VM flags and security features
- `lib/wanderer_notifier/api/controllers/health_controller.ex` - Complete rewrite
- `scripts/production_deployment_verification.sh` - New comprehensive verification script

**Key Changes**:
- Production configuration with structured logging, performance tuning, and optimized connection pools
- Docker image optimized with dumb-init, non-root user, and Erlang performance flags
- Health check endpoints with detailed readiness/liveness checks
- Production deployment verification script with comprehensive checks

### Task 6.6: Final Integration & Documentation
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Completed Sub-tasks**:
- ✅ Perform final code review and cleanup
- ✅ Run final quality gates (format, dialyzer, credo)
- ✅ Update all documentation to reflect new architecture
- ✅ Update developer setup and contribution guides  
- ✅ Run full system integration testing
- ✅ Create production deployment checklist

**Deliverables**:
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Comprehensive development guide with setup instructions, code organization, testing strategy, and contribution guidelines
- `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Complete production deployment checklist with pre-deployment validation, deployment procedures, post-deployment verification, and operational procedures
- Updated `README.md` - Reflects current architecture and features
- Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Current system design and patterns
- Updated `DISCORD_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Discord bot configuration guide

### Additional Work Completed

#### Legacy Code Removal
- Removed `map_url_with_name` from config, runtime.exs, and provider.ex
- Cleaned up backward compatibility code
- Removed migration-related logging that was causing startup noise

#### Critical Bug Fixes
1. **Cache Warmer FunctionClauseError**
   - Added handlers for Task completion messages
   - Added job timeout handling
   - Added Task DOWN message handling

2. **Compilation and Type Errors**
   - Fixed unused variable warnings
   - Fixed Dialyzer guard clause issues
   - Fixed undefined function calls

#### Code Quality
- All files properly formatted
- No compilation warnings
- No Dialyzer type errors
- No high-priority Credo issues

### Final Summary

Sprint 6 has been **successfully completed** with all objectives achieved:

#### Key Accomplishments
1. **Production Optimization** - Enhanced configuration, Docker optimization, comprehensive health checks
2. **Legacy Code Cleanup** - Removed deprecated functions and unnecessary migration code
3. **Rate Limiting Improvements** - Exponential backoff, proper startup handling, middleware bypass for critical services
4. **Bug Fixes** - Resolved compilation errors, Dialyzer issues, and cache warmer crashes
5. **Documentation & Deployment** - Complete development guides, production deployment checklist, updated architecture documentation

#### Quality Gates Passed
