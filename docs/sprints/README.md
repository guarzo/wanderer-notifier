# Wanderer Notifier - Sprint Plans

> **Generated from**: ideas.md Architecture Improvement Ideas  
> **Planning Date**: 2025-01-14  
> **Total Duration**: 12 weeks (6 sprints)  
> **Quality Gates**: mix format, mix dialyzer, mix credo must pass before each commit

## Sprint Overview

Each sprint follows this quality assurance pattern:

1. Implement feature/improvement
2. Run quality checks: `mix format`, `mix dialyzer`, `mix credo`
3. Ensure all checks pass with clean results
4. Commit changes with descriptive message
5. Move to next task
