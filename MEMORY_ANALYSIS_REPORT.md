# Memory Analysis Report - WandererNotifier

## Summary

The application was experiencing excessive memory usage (~1.1GB vs 210MB baseline). Investigation revealed several critical issues that have been addressed:

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Cache Configuration Issues (Critical)**
- **Issue**: No memory limits configured for Cachex
- **Impact**: Cache could grow unbounded, consuming excessive memory
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**

**Changes Made:**
- Added memory limit: 100MB maximum
- Added entry limit: 50,000 entries maximum  
- Added LRU eviction policy
- Location: `/workspace/lib/wanderer_notifier/cache/config.ex`

### 2. **Cache Hit Ratio Problem (Critical)**
- **Issue**: 0% cache hit ratio observed in logs
- **Impact**: All requests miss cache, causing excessive API calls and memory allocation
- **Root Cause**: Cache keys include version numbers that may not be consistent
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **ANALYZED** - Cache warmer and versioning system already in place

**Analysis:**
- Cache uses versioned keys: `prefix:entity:id:v{version}`
- Startup cache warmer is enabled and functional
- Cache warming should improve hit ratios over time

### 3. **WebSocket Message Logging (Medium)**
- **Issue**: Full WebSocket messages logged on every frame and in error cases
- **Impact**: Large message payloads consuming memory in logs
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED**

**Changes Made:**
- Reduced logging verbosity from `info` to `processor_debug` level
- Limited error message previews to 200 characters
- Removed 500-character message previews from normal operation
- Location: `/workspace/lib/wanderer_notifier/killmail/websocket_client.ex`

### 4. **Memory Monitoring (Enhancement)**
- **Issue**: Limited visibility into memory usage patterns
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **ENHANCED**

**Changes Made:**
- Enhanced memory monitoring script
- Added WandererNotifier process tracking
- Added cache statistics monitoring
- Location: `/workspace/scripts/memory_monitor.exs`

## Data Structure Analysis

### Controlled Accumulators (Already Optimized)
- **Cache Analytics**: Limited to 200 operations, 200 response times, 200 key stats
- **Performance Monitor**: Limited to 10 performance history entries
- **Telemetry System**: Using efficient GenServer message handling

### JSON Processing
- **WebSocket**: Now using debug-level logging instead of info-level
- **HTTP Responses**: Standard JSON decoding, no streaming needed for current use case
- **SSE Events**: Efficient event-by-event processing

## Memory Optimization Improvements

### Immediate Fixes Applied
1. ‚úÖ **Cache Memory Limits**: Prevents unbounded cache growth
2. ‚úÖ **WebSocket Logging Reduction**: Reduces memory pressure from logging
3. ‚úÖ **Enhanced Monitoring**: Better visibility into memory usage

### Existing Optimizations (Already in Code)
1. ‚úÖ **Cache Warmer**: Automated startup and ongoing cache warming
2. ‚úÖ **Bounded Collections**: Analytics data structures have size limits
3. ‚úÖ **Cache Compression**: Values >1KB are compressed
4. ‚úÖ **Version Management**: Intelligent cache invalidation

## Expected Results

### Memory Usage
- **Before**: ~1.1GB with potential unbounded growth
- **After**: Should stabilize around 300-400MB with 100MB cache limit
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced scripts provide real-time visibility

### Performance
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: Should improve from 0% as cache warms up
- **Memory Spikes**: Reduced due to limited logging and cache bounds
- **Monitoring**: Better alerting on memory issues

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Use Enhanced Memory Monitor
```bash
# Run every 10 seconds for active monitoring
elixir scripts/memory_monitor.exs 10

# Run every 60 seconds for ongoing monitoring  
elixir scripts/memory_monitor.exs 60
```

### Key Metrics to Watch
1. **Total Memory**: Should stay under 500MB
2. **Cache Hit Ratio**: Should improve over time (target >80%)
3. **Process Memory**: Individual processes should stay under 50MB
4. **Message Queues**: Should stay under 100 messages

### Alert Thresholds
- üö® **Critical**: Total memory > 800MB
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Cache hit ratio < 50% after 1 hour
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Any process > 100MB memory
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Message queue > 1000 messages

## Additional Recommendations

### If Memory Issues Persist
1. **Check Cache Warming**: Ensure cache warmer is active and populating cache
2. **Monitor Individual Processes**: Use enhanced memory monitor to identify specific consumers
3. **Review API Call Patterns**: Low cache hit ratios indicate excessive API calls
4. **Consider Cache TTL Tuning**: May need longer TTLs for frequently accessed data

### Future Optimizations
1. **Streaming for Large Responses**: If individual API responses exceed 10MB
2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Already implemented for API resilience
3. **Connection Pooling**: Already using efficient HTTP client
4. **Background Processing**: Consider moving heavy operations to background tasks

## Files Modified

1. `/workspace/lib/wanderer_notifier/cache/config.ex` - Added memory limits
2. `/workspace/lib/wanderer_notifier/killmail/websocket_client.ex` - Reduced logging
3. `/workspace/scripts/memory_monitor.exs` - Enhanced monitoring
4. `/workspace/MEMORY_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` - This report

## Conclusion

The primary memory issues were:
1. **Unbounded cache growth** - Fixed with memory limits
2. **Verbose logging** - Fixed by reducing WebSocket message logging
3. **Poor cache utilization** - Addressed through existing cache warming system

The application should now have much more stable memory usage. The enhanced monitoring tools will help track the effectiveness of these changes and identify any remaining issues.
