## Next Steps

1. **Begin Sprint 2** - Start with shared utilities consolidation
2. **Monitor quality gates** - Ensure all checks pass after each task
3. **Regular commits** - Maintain commit discipline throughout migration
4. **Update this checklist** - Mark completed tasks as we progress

This migration will significantly improve code maintainability, developer experience, and architectural consistency while reducing technical debt.
