# Global Project Guidelines

## Code Quality
- Maintain consistency and clarity in all code.
- Keep functions and modules focused on a single responsibility.
- Use meaningful, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity—simplify logic where possible.

## Structured Change Management (MECE Process)
- **Use the MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) approach** when breaking down tasks:
  - Ensure tasks are clear, non-overlapping, and comprehensive.
  - Each change should be well-scoped and limited in impact.
- **Pre-Implementation Discussion:** If an update modifies more than **three files**, a discussion must occur before proceeding.
  - Provide a high-level summary of the proposed changes.
  - Break large updates into smaller, incremental changes if needed.
- **Code Review Process:** All major changes must be reviewed before merging to maintain consistency and prevent regressions.

## Documentation & Communication
- Keep comprehensive documentation and update it regularly.
- Store all project documentation in the `notes/` directory.
- Maintain a changelog for significant updates.

## Testing & Validation
- Implement thorough testing before committing changes.
- Ensure all unit and integration tests pass before merging.
- Handle errors gracefully—never allow silent failures.
