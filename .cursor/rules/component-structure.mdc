# Component Structure Guidelines

- **Folder Organization:**  
  - Each component should reside in its own folder following this pattern:
    ```
    MyComponent/
    ├── index.ts
    ├── MyComponent.tsx
    ├── MyComponent.module.scss (optional)
    ├── components/ (optional)
    ├── helpers/ (optional)
    ├── hooks/ (optional)
    ├── types.ts (optional)
    └── constants.ts (optional)
    ```
- **Component Size:**  
  - Aim to keep components under 250 lines; extract logic into custom hooks or helper files as needed.
- **Performance:**  
  - Use React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo to minimize unnecessary re-renders.
- **Code Clarity:**  
  - Separate subcomponents, constants, and helper functions into dedicated files.
- **Reference:**  
  - See @notes/frontend_guidelines.md for examples.
