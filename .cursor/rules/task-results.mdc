# Task Results Documentation Guidelines

- **Outcome Documentation:**  
  - Clearly record the outcome of each task in @notes/conversation_summary.md.
- **Issue & Follow-Up:**  
  - Log any issues or further actions required.
- **Review Process:**  
  - Use documented results to refine processes and improve future task breakdowns.
